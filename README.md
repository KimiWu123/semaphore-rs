# semaphore-rs

Rust support library for using [semaphore](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore). It's mostly a Rust rewrite of [zk-kit](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zk-kit), but just focuses on semaphore. It's using [ark-circom](https://github.com/gakonst/ark-circom) under the hood for generating the groth16 proofs.
